@component

Renders an all-included post with metadata and buttons.

There are three distinct sections.

__The first section displays:__
* The poster's avatar
* The poster's nickname
* The date of the post

__The second section displays either a text and/or (an) image(s):__
* If a text is set, it shows up as standalone if no images was provided
* If there's a least 1 image: displays an image carousel if there are multiple images, or a static image placeholder if there is one
* When both are set, the text is displayed under the image(s)

__The third section displays:__
* The like count of the post
* 3 buttons : like, bookmark and open the comments section
